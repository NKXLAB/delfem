This is a document for DelFEM library.
DelFEM : http://code.google.com/p/delfem/

DelFEM is a library, which try to provide a handy environment for creating Finite Element Method (FEM) programs. 


*Build

DelFEM is written in C++, so probably you can compile it with many different C++ compilers. But I recommend you to use gcc with which I usually compile the library. 

GLUT system is also an requirement to build the library.

**Windows

To use gcc in windows, you can use MinGW. 
MinGW : http://www.mingw.org/

For the GLUT system, please install freeGLUT for MinGW.
Free GLUT: http://freeglut.sourceforge.net/

Please build the library by execute command "make" for the library Makefile at "DelFEM/Makefile". The make command of MinGW is "mingw32-make".

**Linux

Please build the library by execute command "make" for the library Makefile at "DelFEM/Makefile". 

**Mac

You can either make this system with "make" command or using Mac XCode system. The XCode project file for building DelFEM library is in "DelFEM/lib/xcodelib_core/"




*Examples

Example projects are placed in (DelFEM/test_glut/).
Since there is no detailed manual for this library, I recommend to learn the usage from the examples.
