===How to get total number of nodes in mesh ?===

Msh::CMesher2D have a function to get a array of node coordinates: 

{{{
const std::vector<Com::CVector2D>& Msh::CMesher2D::GetVectorAry() const
}}}

and please get number of points as 

{{{
CMesher2D mesh;
unsigned int nnode = mesh.GetVectorAry().size(); // number of nodes
}}}
